    <h2>Beginners recipe to making soft delicious bread.</h2>
    <p>Recipe ingredients</p>
    <ul> 
      <li>warm water</li>
      <li>granulated sugar</li>  
      <li>instant OR active dry yeast,</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>vegetable or canola oil</li>
      <li>flour</li>
      
    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li> ASSEMBLE BREAD INGREDIENTS
      </li>
      <li>DISSOLVE THE YEAST AND ACTIVATE IT BY PROOFING:This is a simple process that takes about 5 minutes. You can see a picture below what yeast looks like when it’s proofed. It’s possible to kill yeast if you use too hot of water, so aim for slightly warmer than luke-warm, or about 105°F. Combine warm water, yeast and 1 TBSP of the granulated sugar in your mixing bowl. Give it a quick stir and then let it sit for 5 minutes. You’ll begin to see the yeast puff up until it covers the entire surface of the water.</li>
      <li>ADD REMAINING INGREDIENTS AND MIX</li>
      <li>KNEAD THE BREAD</li>
      <li>Place your lovely smooth, elastic bread dough in an oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a clean towel. I think plastic wrap works better because it traps hot air inside and thus, my dough requires a shorter first rise. Be sure to spray the side of the plastic wrap that will touch the dough with oil!
      </li>
      <li> PUNCH DOUGH AND SHAPE IT</li>   
      <li>Bake the bread for 30 to 40 minutes</li>
      <li></li>
    </ol>
